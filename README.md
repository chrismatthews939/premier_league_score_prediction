# Premier League Result Prediction ML Project

## Overview

The **Premier League Result Predictor** is an ML project designed to teach a beginner or practice the basics of machine learning in python. The steps are data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and ultimately testing various ML models to see which perform best for predicting the result of football matches using evalution metrics. In this project I tested logistic regression, xgboost and random forest. I built a webscraper to extract the data for the last four premier league seasons from www.football-data.co.uk (file outputs included).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data and visualise in a Jupyter notebook.
- **EDA:** Analyse the data, look for outliers and visualise the distributions in a Jupyter notebook.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create the features to be used in the modelling in a Jupyter notebook.
- **Training:** Train the model and compare models using sklearn.
